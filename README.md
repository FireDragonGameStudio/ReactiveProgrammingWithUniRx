# Reactive Programming with Unity3D and UniRx
A few examples of reactive programming in Unity3D with the Asset UniRx. Hopefully this project will grow in future and a lot more examples will be added.

This little project contains just a few examples of using reactive operators, multithreading and Unity basics. For a more detailed explanation of UniRx check out https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx and for more information about reactive programming make sure to read [The introduction to Reactive Programming you've been missing](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754).

A little sample game called "Reactive Hero" is also part of this repo. A video of how it looks can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAasM5lVCR0
